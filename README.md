## App Resume

The app only has one screen:
[x] Home
The home screen is where eveything happens. When the app is opened, the user is redirected to the `HomeView` and the cubit run the `fetchData()` function, returning the `List<EodModel>` or the `status code(integer)` obtained from the API.
While the function is running, a loadscreen is shown to the user with the `Shimmer` effect.
If everything goes ok with the API, a `ListView` is builded. Each component from this list is a `Card` showing the company name, date, open and close value.
The business-logic from the leading icon is:
If the open value is lower than close value from that day, the icon will be green.
The search box was created with the `Autocomplete` widget, and the date range picker was created with `showDateRangePicker` function, both are native from Flutter.

## Pattern and State Management

> The app was developed with the BLoC(Cubit) state management.

> The project was created always thinking and applying the S.O.L.I.D principles and the best development practices.

> Focused on the deadline, complex components were not used for app development, only those that the Flutter provides.

## Tests

Created the unit test to API connexion. To pass the test, is expected a `List<EodModel>`, and if the API request get failure, it will return an `int` or a `null`.
